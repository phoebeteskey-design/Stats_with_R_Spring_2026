## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Problem #1

1. Under highly favorable conditions, populations grow exponentially. However resources will eventually limit population growth and exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. This phenomenon is described by the logistic growth function:

N_t=(KN_0)/〖N_0+(K-N_0)e〗^(-rt) 

where Nt is the population size at time t, N0 is the initial population size, r is the rate of growth or reproductive rate, and K is the carrying capacity.

Write a logistic growth function in R that also generates a plot with time on the x axis and Nt on the y axis. Using that function create 3 separate plots for 20 days assuming an initial population size of 10 individuals and a carrying capacity of 1,000 individuals under 3 growth rate scenarios (0.5, 0.8, 0.4).
Plot the previous results (that is, 3 growth rate scenarios) in a single plot using ggplot2.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

logistic_growth <- function(pop_size) {
  pop_size <- (KN_0)/(N_0+(K-N_0)e)^(-rt) 
  return(pop_size) 
}
```

Problem #2

a)	A function (sum_n) that for any given value, say n, computes the sum of the integers from 1 to n (inclusive). Use the function to determine the sum of integers from 1 to 5,000.


```{r}
n <- 1:5000

sum_n <- function(n){
  sum <- sum(1:length(n))
  return(sum)
}

sum_n(n)

```
b)	A function (sqrt_round) that takes a number x as input, takes the square root, rounds it to the nearest whole number and then returns the result.

```{r}
sqrt_round <- function(x) {
  sqrt <- x^(1/2)
  rounded <- round(sqrt)
  return(rounded)
}

sqrt_round(13)
```
